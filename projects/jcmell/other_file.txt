### Abstract

While early multicellular lineages necessarily started out as relatively simple groups of cells, little is known about how they became Darwinian entities capable of sustained multicellular evolution1-3. Here we investigate this with a multicellularity long-term evolution experiment, selecting for larger group size in the snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) model system. Given the historical importance of oxygen limitation4, our ongoing experiment consists of three metabolic treatments5-anaerobic, obligately aerobic and mixotrophic yeast. After 600 rounds of selection, snowflake yeast in the anaerobic treatment group evolved to be macroscopic, becoming around 2 × 104 times larger (approximately mm scale) and about 104-fold more biophysically tough, while retaining a clonal multicellular life cycle. This occurred through biophysical adaptation-evolution of increasingly elongate cells that initially reduced the strain of cellular packing and then facilitated branch entanglements that enabled groups of cells to stay together even after many cellular bonds fracture. By contrast, snowflake yeast competing for low oxygen5 remained microscopic, evolving to be only around sixfold larger, underscoring the critical role of oxygen levels in the evolution of multicellular size. Together, this research provides unique insights into an ongoing evolutionary transition in individuality, showing how simple groups of cells overcome fundamental biophysical limitations through gradual, yet sustained, multicellular evolution.

## PRJNA970274 - Yeast in Lactic Acid

### Paper 

Currently unpublished.

### Summary

The model yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used in many fundamental and applied research applications, including biosensors and production of many compounds.
However, given the enormous work invested in the studies of yeast transcription response to various conditions, there are still substances not explored in this regard.
In this work, we explore the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to a wide range of concentrations of the D-enantiomer of lactic acid and compare it to the response to L-lactic acid.
Of these conditions, we only recorded a transcriptional response to the relatively high concentrations of DLA of 5 and 45 mM, as well as to 45 mM LLA.
Our data did not reveal any natural yeast promoters that quantitatively sense D-lactic acid but provide the first description of the transcriptome-wide response to DLA, as well as enrich our understanding of the LLA response.

### Overall design

In this work, we explore the transcriptional response of a commonly used S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 to a wide range of concentrations of the D-enantiomer of lactic acid (0.05, 0.5, 5, 45 mM) for the first time and compare it to the response to 45 mM L-lactic acid (LLA).
The exposure of the indicated concentrations in shake flask cultures lasted for 3 hours.

### Abstract

The genome-wide protein architecture of chromatin that maintains chromosome integrity and gene regulation is ill-defined.
Here we use ChIP-exo/seq to define this structure in Saccharomyces.
We identified 21 ensembles consisting of ~400 different proteins related to DNA replication, centromeres, subtelomeres, transposons, and RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II, and III transcription.
Replication proteins engulfed a nucleosome, centromeres lacked a nucleosome, and repressive proteins encompassed three nucleosomes at subtelomeric X-elements.
We find that most Pol II promoters evolved to lack a regulatory region, having only a core promoter.
These constitutive promoters comprised a short nucleosome-free region (NFR) adjacent to a +1 nucleosome, which together bound TFIID to form a preinitiation complex (PIC).
Positioned insulators protected core promoters from upstream events.
A small fraction of promoters were architected for inducibility, wherein sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) create a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) that is distinct from NFRs.
We describe TF structural interactions with the genome and cognate cofactors, including nucleosomal and transcriptional regulators RPD3-L, SAGA, NuA4, Tup1, Mediator, and SWI-SNF.
Surprisingly, we do not detect TF-TFIID interactions, suggesting that they do not stably occur.
Our model for gene induction involves TFs, cofactors, and general factors like TBP and TFIIB, but not TFIID.
However, constitutive transcription involves TFIID but not TFs and cofactors.
From this we define a highly integrated network of TF-regulated transcription.
