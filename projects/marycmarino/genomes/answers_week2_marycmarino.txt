1. To find the original dataset directory: cd (to change working directories) and ls (to see the contents of the directory)
2. To move my dataset to genomes: cp -r ~/share/courses/OMICS/wk02_dataset/ ~/repos/OMICS/projects/marycmarino/genomes/
3. Path to /genomes = ~/repos/OMICS/projects/marycmarino/genomes
4. I like less for viewing the data files because it's easier to manage for such a large document
5. All four files are the same size.
6. The command ls -lh lists the file sizes.
7. The flag -h stands for "human readable," and the flag -l stands for "long listing format"
