# About Project Data
The HIV proviral sequence from samples from the `spleen` and `brains` of individuals living with HIV were sequenced using the `nanopore sequencer`. The directory contains the aligned reads for 3 samples, 2 `MFG (mid-frontal girus)` and 1 `(SPL) spleen` from 2 individuals.
These are from human brains from the `National Neuro AIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC)`.
