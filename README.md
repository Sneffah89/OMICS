## Course 

### Course Description

Recent advances in molecular biology and computational achievements have generated an explosion of data that surveys biological processes on a massive scale.
Collectively referred to as ‘omics scale data, these techniques have revolutionized our ability to explore complex phenotypes in microbiology & immunology.
This course covers the history, application, and computational analysis of ‘omics scale data and provides hands-on analysis experience. 

### Course Objectives

1. Recognize popular next-generation sequencing technologies and distinguish their appropriate uses. 
2. Recognize how to apply OMICS scale techniques to multiple facets of microbiology and immunology. 
3. Design OMICS scale experiments to inspect biological functions across DNA, RNA, and proteins. 
4. Perform basic terminal activities such as moving, copying, inspecting files, and calling installed tools as well as employ pipes to chain small functions together to create complex analyses. 
5. Utilize Jupyter Notebooks to perform data analysis and visualization of OMICS scale data. 
6. Practice presenting OMICS scale data analysis to both traditional & computational biological audiences.

## Repository Layout

This repository contains all of the learning content for the course and will be the way you submit all assignments.

The `content` folder contains the learning content organized by week.
You will `pull` this from the main repository each week.

Within each week's assignment you will be asked to create a `notes_{github-user}.md` file as you complete the assignments in each week's folder.
As you complete the assignment you will commit these notes and when complete, make PRs to the main repository.
This is how you will _submit_ assignments.

The `projects` folder contains information about the ongoing project and is where you will keep information and notes.
