# Walkthrough

For your project.
 - Choose a login name for https://github.com. Most choose one of two naming styles:
   - Professional: Your initials and last name
   - Fun
   - Techy or Gamer-style
 - Fork from https://github.com/DamLabResources/OMICS
 - Clone from https://github.com/yourgitlogin/OMICS
 - On your PC, add your project directory (`OMICS/projects/yourgitlogin`) and create a `README.md`:
```
$ cd OMICS
$ cd projects
$ mkdir yourgitlogin
$ cd yourgitlogin
$ pwd
  ~OMICS/projects/yourgitlogin
$ nano README.md  
$ git status
$ git add README.md
$ git commit README.md -m 'Beginnings of my project README'
```
