# Grading

As part of each week you will have an assignment and project task.
These will ask you to generate notes, update project readmes, do background literature searches, etc.
Grading will be done through submitting Github Pull Requests.

When submitting an assignment through a pull request we'll provide feedback for improvements.
When the assignment is complete, we will merge your PR and adjust the grading tables in this folder.
